# Predicting Movie Ratings from Reviews Using Naive Bayes

### Background
In this project a subset of movie reviews from the rotten tomatoes database has been used. Rotten tomatoes classifies reviews for movies and series as rotten (bad reviews) or fresh (good reviews). They also provide an average rating.

### Analysis
In the mini-project we use a fundamental technique in Bayesian inference, called Naive Bayes. This mini-project is based on Lab 10 of Harvard's CS109 class.
